                                    <h2>{Revolving Change} Founder</h2> 
                                    <p>am a self-made, self-taught entrepreneur, doer, and implementer. I made a career in what I cornered as <strong> HUMAN ENGINEERING </strong>  serving managers and leaders around the world anchoring, implementing, and perpetuating the mindset, attitudes, and behaviours that are the foundation for excellence. Revolving Change is the never-ending process of self-discovery, of evolution. It demands relentless curiosity and the willingness to question oneself aspiring to always find a better way to serve. If we serve we grow.</p>
                                    <p>Native from Uruguay, raised German. after an eventful childhood and youth I emigrated to Germany and never looked back. I always worked, since my young age on holidays, as a sailor to travel to Europe and in always new industries, each time learning new skills. My introversion and shyness drove me to want to understand persons in their culture, environment, and in their language, hence the 6 languages I speak well and a few more that I manage to have some understanding.</p>
                                    <p>Sports always played a pivotal role in my life, less socially, but more character-forming, developing perseverance, resourcefulness, determination, and learning very early on that winning is not always important but serving team members, sharing, and always doing better than last time are the essence.</p>

                     <p>Circumstances often force young people into situations where decisions are made for them and where opportunities that arise are or are not capitalised on. I did. I collected experiences in the most varied possible industries, from a timer to music, from hotels to service companies. There was not a challenge I was not willing to take. Often I wondered how much of that was conscious decision or desperation. On several occasions, not just a few, I was called for an interview during which it turned I candidly volunteered the fact that I had zero experience and even less knowledge needed for the position I was being offered. </p>
                     <p>On every single occasion, I was told: <strong> you  are a learner, you are resourceful, you will learn, </strong>  They were right and I never disappointed any of them. This opened a new world to learning coaching and management skills, management systems design and implementation, Kaizen, and TQM which were turned to be the key for me to learn to draw strength from my introversion and shyness, the rest is history.</p>
                     <p>My relentless almost fanatic curiosity and also creativity, always asking why?, questioning the old ways, drove me to be attracted to my partners that played a massive role in my and our success. and my partners with whom I worked closely for the last 30 years, and closely means closely. I never succeeded in doing business with friends, but my dearest business partners have all become the dearest of friends, true family.</p>
                     <p>We founded several companies mostly in the Corporate Management Coaching, Change engineering, and implementation, amongst them Business Coaching Europe (BCE) in 1987. We coached and served clients, large corporations but also high-worth individuals, all in 23+ countries in several languages. Continuous improvement was the hallmark of our approach. We guaranteed results and still do because we know our capabilities and that of our clients, because we only engage with those committed to excellence and are determined, and resilient and will not give up.</p>
                     <p>Of course, Groupware Automation was unavoidable as has also become social media, which we decided to picot and embrace when we realised how many clients were needing guidance, support, and encouragement, perspectives on how to cope with the unknown. The latest addition Revolving Change brings to bear the many decades of combined experience coaching, implementing change, serving at the highest level across western and eastern Europe, the Americas, and Southeast Asia.</p>
                     <p><strong>Revolving Change</strong> recognises the ravages and unprecedented challenges everyone is facing from the pandemic and are therefore focusing on a broader audience and continue to serve and share our knowledge and experience, giving access to the coaching and teaching of management skills needed to meet the new <strong> REVOLVING CHANGING </strong>requirements of these new uncharted waters.
